# CQCAD

This is a collection of random parts I have designed in [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery). They're on Github so I can sync changes easily between machines, and so I don't lose anything.

The files in this repository are licensed under CC0, which means approximately (do not hold me to this) "you can do whatever you want with these files". You can modify, redistribute, use commercially, and do not have to give credit. On the flipside I am not a CAD expert and I make no representation as to the quality of these parts, so watch your step.
